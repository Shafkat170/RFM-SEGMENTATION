# RFM Segmentation Using SQL on Sales Data
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation using SQL on real-world sales transaction data. The objective is to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior to help businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.

# What is RFM?
RFM is a marketing analysis technique used to quantitatively rank and segment customers based on:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.

Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.

Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends.
